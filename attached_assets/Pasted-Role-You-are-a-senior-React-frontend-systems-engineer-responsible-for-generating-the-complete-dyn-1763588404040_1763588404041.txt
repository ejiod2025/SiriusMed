Role

You are a senior React & frontend systems engineer responsible for generating the complete dynamic Adherence Webpage for SiriusMed.
Your task is to transform high-level content into interactive, animated, production-ready UI components using React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Framer Motion.

The webpage focuses on these pillars:

The Medication Adherence Gap

The Patient Journey After Prescription

Multi-channel Adherence Experience
(WhatsApp, Voice Calls, Notifications, SMS)

Continuous health support between clinic visits

Dynamic storytelling animations

You generate components, UI structures, copy blocks, timelines, and channel simulations—everything required for a full dynamic landing page.

Primary Objectives

Generate React components that bring the Adherence product story to life.

Produce dynamic sections with animations (scroll, fade, channel switchers, timelines).

Structure content for a modular landing page (hero, channel tabs, patient journey, clinical gap section, continuous care, CTA).

Ensure design consistency with Tailwind + motion.

Output code that is drop-in-ready for Next.js or CRA environments.

Core Capabilities

You can generate:

1. Hero Sections

Multi-layer animations

Dynamic messaging around “prescription → real life → adherence gap”

2. Channel Switcher Components

Each channel must support:

WhatsApp dynamic mock conversation

Voice call transcript animation

Notification cards with state awareness

SMS fallback thread

3. Patient Journey Timeline

A scroll-driven experience showing:

Day 0: Prescription issued

First 48 hours

Week 2–4

Month 3+ continuous health
Each stage should include UI elements that animate into view.

4. Clinical Gap Visualization

Illustrate:

“Care inside the clinic”

“Chaos outside the clinic”

How SiriusMed bridges the gap

5. Adherence Engine Visuals

Components showing:

State machine

Dose event logic

Risk detection

Streak tracking

6. CTA & Footer Sections
Design Requirements

Framework: React + TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Animation: Framer Motion

Layout system: Responsive, mobile-first

Components: Encapsulated, portable, minimal prop API

Optimized for dynamic landing pages
## 1. Hero – “From Prescription to Everyday Life”

**Headline:**
**From “Here’s your prescription” to “I’ve actually taken it.”**

**Subheadline:**
SiriusMed Adherence is the always-on companion that walks with patients *after* they leave the clinic—over WhatsApp, voice calls, SMS, and intelligent notifications.

**Body:**
Most care stops at the prescription.
We step in from the first dose and stay with the patient for every pill, inhaler, injection, and refill—turning treatment plans into lived routines, not forgotten instructions.

**CTA buttons:**

* **See the patient journey**
* **Watch a WhatsApp conversation**

**Animation idea:**

* Center: animated phone UI.
* Tabs auto-switch between **WhatsApp**, **Phone Call**, **Notification**, **SMS**, showing the *same dose* being nudged in different channels.
* A subtle timeline under the phone animates: **“Prescription written → Day 1 → Day 14 → Month 3”**, with dots lighting up as the phone UI changes.

## 2. The Gap – What Happens After “You’re Good to Go”

**Headline:**
What happens after the prescription is printed?

**Body:**
In the exam room, everything is clear:
why the medication matters, how to take it, what to watch for.

But once patients leave:

* Instructions blur into everyday chaos
* Side effects raise silent doubts
* Doses collide with work, kids, traffic, and stress
* Providers only hear about “non-adherence” when it’s already a problem

**Bottom line:** there’s a **huge care gap** between *prescribing* and *actually taking medication consistently*.

**Animation idea:**

* A simple **clinic room illustration** on the left fades out into a **busy real-life scene** (bus stop, kitchen, office).
* Text overlay:

  * Step 1: “Prescription given” (glows briefly, then fades)
  * Step 2: “Life gets in the way” (calendar tiles, notifications, work emails crowd the screen)

---

## 3. Where SiriusMed Steps In – Continuous Health Layer

**Headline:**
SiriusMed lives in the gap between visits.

**Body:**
SiriusMed becomes the **continuous health layer** between clinic appointments:

* Translates the prescription into a **daily, conversational plan**
* Follows the patient in the channels they already use
* Adapts to real life—traffic, shift work, bad days, flare-ups
* Gives clinicians a live view of what’s *actually happening* with every dose

We don’t replace providers.
We extend their care into the 99% of time patients spend *outside* the clinic.

**Animation idea:**

* A **bridge graphic** between “Clinic Visit” and “Next Appointment.”
* The bridge is made of WhatsApp bubbles, call waveforms, and notification cards that assemble as you scroll.
* Small “patients” walk across, and under the bridge you see labels like “Missed doses,” “Side effects,” “Forgetfulness” fading out.

---

## 4. Multi-Channel Experience – WhatsApp, Calls, Notifications, SMS

### 4.1 WhatsApp Companion

**Subheading:**
WhatsApp: adherence in the patient’s primary chat app.

**Body:**
Patients talk to SiriusMed on WhatsApp just like they talk to friends and family:

* Friendly dose nudges (“Hey Daniel, it’s time for your evening dose of Lisinopril 10 mg. Want to take it now?”)
* One-tap responses: **Taken**, **Snooze**, **Skip**, **Not feeling well**
* Voice notes for patients who prefer speaking over typing
* Follow-up questions handled in natural language: “Can I take this with food?”, “I feel dizzy today.”

**Animation idea:**

* A **live WhatsApp chat mock** scrolls upward:

  * Agent: “Morning Daniel, ready for your Metformin 500 mg?”
  * Patient taps “Taken ✅”
  * Agent: “Nice job – that’s 5 days in a row 👏”
* As each message appears, a small **adherence meter** on the side fills up.

---

### 4.2 Voice Calling

**Subheading:**
Voice calls: for elders, low literacy, and complex regimens.

**Body:**
For patients who prefer hearing a voice or can’t read messages easily, SiriusMed makes proactive, natural voice calls:

* Gentle reminders that sound like a supportive nurse, not a robocall
* Simple yes/no or numeric keypad responses
* Support for multiple languages and accents
* Smart retry logic if a call is missed, with fallback to WhatsApp or SMS

**Animation idea:**

* Phone UI with a **waveform** reacting as the “agent” speaks.
* Subtitles animate:

  * “Hi Mrs. Okafor, it’s time for your blood pressure medication. Did you take it yet?”
  * Buttons below: “1 – Yes”, “2 – Not yet”, “3 – I’m feeling unwell”.

---

### 4.3 Smart Notifications

**Subheading:**
Intelligent notifications—not spam.

**Body:**
SiriusMed doesn’t blast generic alerts.
Every notification is **timed, contextual, and state-aware**:

* Skips sending if a dose was just confirmed as taken
* Sends softer language after a tough day (“Let’s try again together”)
* Bundles multiple meds into a **single, digestible reminder**
* Pauses nudges when the patient is hospitalized or regimen is changed

**Animation idea:**

* Notification stack slides in from the side.
* Some cards auto-dismiss with a “✔ Already taken via WhatsApp” tag.
* Others expand when hovered: showing short explanations, e.g. “New timing after your doctor’s update.”

---

### 4.4 SMS Fallback

**Subheading:**
SMS: low-data, low-friction backup.

**Body:**
When data is poor or WhatsApp isn’t available, SiriusMed falls back to **plain SMS**:

* Clean, short, actionable messages
* Simple reply patterns (“YES”, “NO”, “LATER”, “HELP”)
* Same adherence engine, different channel

Patients don’t have to remember apps—just reply to a text.

**Animation idea:**

* The screen shows WhatsApp failing (“No data”), then smoothly transitions into an SMS thread keeping the same conversation context.
* A small **status badge**: “Channel switched: SMS fallback (Queued: 1 → Delivered).”

---

## 5. Patient Journey After Prescription – Storyboard

### 5.1 Day 0 – Prescription Written

**Clinic side:**

* Doctor creates or updates the medication plan.
* SiriusMed syncs via EMR/FHIR or simple upload.

**Patient side:**

* Before leaving, patient receives a **welcome message**:
  “Hi Daniel, I’m your SiriusMed assistant. I’ll help you remember your meds and check in on how you’re feeling. We’ll start tonight at 8pm.”

**Animation idea:**

* Timeline starts at **“Day 0 – Clinic”**.
* A prescription icon morphs into a digital medication plan card.
* A welcome WhatsApp message animates in on the right.

---

### 5.2 First 48 Hours – Getting Started

**What usually happens without SiriusMed:**

* Patient forgets exact timings or food restrictions
* Starts late or misses first few doses
* Hesitates when mild side effects show up

**With SiriusMed:**

* Clear, timed reminders for each new dose
* Mini-education snippets: “Why this med matters today”
* Quick symptom check-ins after initial doses

**Animation idea:**

* A **2-day calendar** animates: “Day 1” and “Day 2”.
* On each time slot (morning/noon/evening), a small icon plays: WhatsApp ping, phone call, SMS bubble.
* Hovering over a slot reveals the exact message that was sent.

---

### 5.3 Week 2–4 – Building Routine

**Body:**
Once the initial friction is solved, SiriusMed focuses on **habit-building**:

* Encourages streaks (“You’ve taken your meds 6 mornings in a row 🎉”)
* Detects drift (“You’re consistently late on evening doses; want to adjust the time?”)
* Offers flexible scheduling (“Shift worker? Let’s re-align this around your nights.”)
* Checks in on mood, sleep, and side effects

**Animation idea:**

* A **habit ring / streak counter** fills as the user “takes” doses in the animated chat.
* A dynamic suggestion pops up: “Looks like 10 PM is tough. Try 9:30 PM instead?” with a “Confirm change” button.

---

### 5.4 Month 3+ – Continuous Health, Not Just Reminders

**Body:**
Over time, SiriusMed becomes a **longitudinal health companion**:

* Highlights trends: “Your afternoon blood pressure readings improved after we shifted your dose.”
* Gives clinicians an **adherence timeline with context**, not just a percentage
* Flags patients quietly slipping: late doses, more “snooze” responses, worrying phrases
* Helps with refills: “You’re 5 days away from finishing this pack. Should we remind you to refill?”

**Animation idea:**

* Scroll-triggered chart: a line showing **adherence over 3 months**, with annotated events (“dose time changed”, “side effects reported”, “dose paused”).
* On scroll, specific chat snapshots appear for each event.

---

## 6. For Clinicians – From Blind Spots to Clear Signals

**Headline:**
You don’t just see “non-adherent.” You see the *why*.

**Body:**
Inside the clinician dashboard:

* Each patient has a **live adherence score** and trendline
* Every missed dose has context: “working late”, “felt dizzy”, “ran out of meds”
* Red-flag phrases trigger alerts and suggested follow-up actions
* Conversations and dose events are EMR-linked and auditable

SiriusMed turns adherence from a black box into a **manageable, proactive workflow**.

**Animation idea:**

* Split-screen: left shows the patient’s WhatsApp/voice journey, right shows the clinician dashboard auto-updating with each interaction.
* A missed-dose conversation on the left lights up a “Needs review” tag on the right.

---

## 7. Closing Section – Continuous Health in Every Channel

**Headline:**
Continuous support, in the channels patients already live in.

**Body:**
SiriusMed Adherence doesn’t ask patients to change their behavior.
It meets them in WhatsApp, on the phone, via SMS, and through intelligent notifications—to quietly move them closer to better health, one dose at a time.

For providers, it’s a new layer of visibility and control.
For patients, it’s the difference between “I’ll try” and “I did it.”

**CTA:**

* **Explore the WhatsApp demo**
* **Walk through a real patient journey**
* **Talk to us about integrating with your EMR**
